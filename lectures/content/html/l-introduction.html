					<h1>What is a standup?</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>TAs and I will take turns conducting a weekly standup for each team lasting 10 minutes</li>
						<li>We will ask you the following three questions to each member of the team:
							<ul>
								<li>What were you able to complete last week?</li>
								<li>What are you currently working on</li> 
								<li>Most Important: What are you currently blocked on?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>THIS IS NOT GRADED BUT IT IS MANDATORY</strong></li>

					<h1>What is a standup?</h1>
