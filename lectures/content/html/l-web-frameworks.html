                # What is a Web Framework?

                - A design pattern can describe how a website functions
                - Includes how does data get stored and updated, and how pages are rendered
                - Hopefully reduces complexity in the development and maintenance of websites

                # Model View Controller (MVC)

                - The one that started them all
                - MVC was used heavily at the beginnings of the internet
                - Key goal is to separate content from presentation
            </script>

                # Let's remember though - before

                - On the web, when MVC was extremely popular websites were mostly server rendered
                - This means for every request, the server was building the html and css for the site dynamically
                - The model in MVC was typically connected to the database
                - This is still used today:
                [LAMP, MEAN, and Ruby on Rails](https://webinerds.com/6-web-development-stacks-try-2017/)
                stacks are typically built using MVC

                # Let's remember though - after

                - Now we can create fully static sites (with React) without the need of a server
                - And use JavaScript to call directly to APIs to provide the dynamic functionality that we need
                - A lot of this is encouraged by the [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/)

                # Modern Web Frameworks

                - As browsers and computers become more powerful, and we've discovered AJAX, now there is increased
                state in the browser
                - Now the model of an application can be found in the browser itself as well as the server rendering it
                - Sometimes, the model on the server doesn't exist at all (in it's entirety)
                - So there was move to incorporate varous forms of MVC to the browser itself

                # "Two way binding" frameworks

                - Angular, Vue.js, Backbone.js are (in my opinion) MVVM frameworks
                - Focus on the two way binding of state to modify the view, and the view to be able to modify the state

                # Pros

                - State of the application is stored on the frontend itself, and the UI is driven by that state
                - UI can directly modify the state and update the backend
                - Backend can directly modify the state and update the UI
                - All without directly interfacing with each other

            <script type="text/template">
                # Cons

                - What happens if the UI and the backend updates the state stored on the frontend at the same time?
                - What happens if a race condition occurs and our frontend state is in a bad state?
                - Angular opted to rewrite their entire library because of the two issues to ensure that their
                two way binding will not run into the above issues
                - Angular allows developers to implement an API to wirte code on how to "two way bind" their modules

                # The move to Immutable state

                - React used a different approach - state that can only be changed via calls to setState
                - Components that render based on an updated snapshot of the state
                - UI events must call setState in order to rerender a component
                - All components can have such state

                # As applications get larger

                - React recommends to pushing state to a parent component and having it pass down to the children
                - This provides a "centralized data store" and makes it easier to communicate in between components
                - Business/UI events are bubbled up to the parent component to change the state

                - Redux is a Flux implementation that attempts to make managing state in user interfaces easier
                - It does this by centralizing the state, and preventing any regular component from modifying the state
                - Even with setState
                - Components can send actions in response to events, and reducers are written to take in actions and
                define independently what the new state would be in response to those actions
                - Components are wired to use this centralized store
