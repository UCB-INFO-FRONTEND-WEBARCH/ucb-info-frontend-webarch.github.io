					<h1>What is an API?</h1>
					<p><strong>From Quora:</strong> An API (Application Programming Interface) is best thought of as a contract provided by one piece of computer software to another.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Simple API: a function in JavaScript</h1>
					<pre>
function getMaximum(num1, num2) {
	/* ...
	   working code
	   ...
	*/

	return answer;
}
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Simple API: a function in JavaScript</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Imagine that you didn't know how that function was implemented</li>
						<li>You only know that you enter two numbers in the function and you receive the greater of those two numbers</li>
						<li><strong>That is an API!</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>API as contract</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>The getMaximum function can be considered as one piece of computer software</li>
						<li>The rest of your code can be considered as another piece of computer software</li>
						<li>The contract between those two pieces of software:
							<ul>
								<li>If you call the getMaximum function and pass it two numbers as data</li>
								<li>It will return a number that is the maximum of the numbers provided.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>API as a contract example</h1>
					<p>../js/api.js</p>
					<pre>
function getMaximum(num1, num2) {
	var answer = num1;

	if (num1 < num2) {
		answer = num2;
	}

	return answer;
}
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>API as a contract example</h1>
					<p>index.html</p>
					<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;button onclick=&quot;alert(getMaximum(5, 3))&quot;&gt;
			Call API function getMaximum
		&lt;/button&gt;
		&lt;script src=&quot;../js/api.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>API as a contract example</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>api.js defined an API action called getMaximum</li>
						<li>It accepts two pieces of information: two numbers</li>
						<li>It returns one piece of information: a number</li>
						<li>Any web page can import api.js and by following the above contract can utilize the getMaximum function</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Now what really is an API?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>When people say an API, they don't really mean what we just covered</li>
						<li>So let's talk about what people really mean when they say &quot;API&quot;</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
					<h1>The power of APIs</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Web applications used to combine all of their functionality in their website</li>
						<li>Now they separated their "functions" into independent APIs so that clients other than their own websites can use it</li>
						<li>So now anyone can access that information</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>The power of APIs Example</h1>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Without API:</strong> An app finds the current weather in London by opening http://www.weather.com/ and reading the web page like a human does, interpreting the content.</li>
						<li><strong>With API:</strong> An app finds the current weather in London by sending a message to the weather.com API (in a structured format like JSON). The weather.com API then replies with a structured response.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>APIs over HTTP</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Let's take that function concept to the Internet</li>
						<li>We can define functions that can be called "through the Internet" using the HTTP protocol</li>
						<li>We can use the same protocol as we do for web servers to send and receive information</li>
						<li>Caveat: Instead of sending HTML/CSS/JS, we send and receive a more structured data representation, like XML or JSON</li>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>JSON</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript Object Notation</li>
						<li>A lightweight format that is used for data interchanging</li>
						<li>It's a subset of the JavaScript language</li>
						<li>It's the way objects are built in JavaScript</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>JSON Example</h1>
					<pre>
{
	"coord": {
		"weather": [
			{
				"id":800,
				"main":"Clear",
				"description":"clear sky",
				"icon":"01d"
			}
		],
		"base": "stations",
		"main": {
			"temp":294.787,

			"temp_max":294.787,
			"sea_level":1032.69,
			"grnd_level":1024.49
		}, ...
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>JSON Example</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>The previous example was the response to a call to the OpenWeather API</li>
						<li>We send a GET request to the OpenWeather API server sending a single parameter:
							<ul>
								<li>"q" to query for the city</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>We get the JSON response from the previous slide</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>How to call an API</h1>
					<p>Let's use curl!</p>
					<pre>
curl -v "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?\
q=Berkeley,ca"
					</pre>

					<h1>API HTTP Response</h1>
					<pre>
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Server: openresty
Date: Fri, 02 Nov 2018 12:34:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 107

	Please see http://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for more info."}
					</pre>

				<section>
					<h1>We got a 401 error</h1>
					<p><strong>From website:</strong> Starting from 9 October 2015 our API requires a valid APPID for access. Note that this does not mean that our API is subscription-only now - please take a minute to register a free account to receive a key.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>We got a 401 error</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Remember that 400s HTTP response codes mean that there is a client error</li>
						<li>So we made a mistake</li>
						<li>Now this openweathermap API requires an appid and it's telling you to sign up and generate one</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>But what is an appid?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Many API's require some sort of identification so that the API knows who is making the requests</li>
						<li>Typically the backend will assign id's by user or by <strong>application</strong> (one user could have several applications)</li>
						<li>Statistics, rate limiting, blocking, and levels of authorization are all possible when you require application ids to be passed on every request</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>How do you typically get an appid?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>First you will need to go to the website that hosts the application and go through their signup process</li>
						<li>Next look for somewhere where they tell you how to use their API: typically they will show you how to generate a new application id</li>
						<li>Let's do this now: <a href="https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in" target="_blank">Openweathermap signup</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Now we have an appid!</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>af578739923ac7f173a6054b24c606ea</li>
						<li>We can now add our appid in our curl query to get a 200 response back</li>
					</ul>
