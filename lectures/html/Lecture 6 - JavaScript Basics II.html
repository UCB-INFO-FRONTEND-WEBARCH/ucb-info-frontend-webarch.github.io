				<section>
					<h1>More JavaScript!</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>We're now going to go to more loops, data structures, and control flow</li>
						<li>The goal is to provide a foundation of understanding how to express yourself in JavaScript</li>
						<li>This will take time dependent on your experience. That's okay</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				
				<section>
					<h1>Conditionals</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Computers execute commands line by line</li>
						<li>But what if you don't want to execute every line</li>
						<li>Have the computer make a decision?</li>
					</ul>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Let's start!</h1>
					<pre>
function getGenerationalCohort(yearBorn) {

	var generationalCohort = ""
	
	if (yearBorn > 1900 &amp;&amp; yearBorn <= 1926) {
		generationCohort = "GI Generation";
	}
	else if (yearBorn > 1926 &amp;&amp; yearBorn <= 1945) {
		generationalCohort = "Silent Generation";
	}
	else if (yearBorn > 1945 &amp;&amp; yearBorn <= 1964) {
		generationalCohort = "Baby Boomers";
	} 
	else if(yearBorn > 1964 &amp;&amp; yearBorn <= 1980) {
		generationalCohort = "Generation X";
	}
	else if(yearBorn > 1980 &amp;&amp; yearBorn <= 2001) {
		generationalCohort = "Millennium";
	}
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section> 
					<h1>Let's start (2)</h1> 
					<pre>
	else if(yearBorn > 2001 &amp;&amp; yearBorn < 2020) {
		generationalCohort = "Generation Z";
	}
	else {
		generationalCohort = "Outside of our named generations";
	}

	return generationalCohort;
}

var year = parseInt(prompt("Enter your year of birth"));
var cohort = getGenerationalCohort(year);
alert("The generational cohort of someone born in " + 
	year + " is: " + cohort + ".");
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>We ask the user their year of birth</li>
						<li>We take that value and check to see which generation cohort the user is</li>
						<li>We print it to the screen</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h1>For Loops</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What are For Loops</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>What computers are good at are doing the same thing over and over again <em>very fast</em>.</li>
						<li>With a for loop, we can define how many times we want something to happen over and over again</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What are For Loops (2)</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>The key to the for loop is the expression that evaluates to a Boolean (true or false)</li>
						<li>While that Boolean is true, the for loop keeps going</li>
						<li>The moment when that Boolean is false, the loop terminates</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Let's use a for loop!</h1>
					<pre>
function countToX(x) {
	
	var message = "";
	for(var i = 0; i <= x; i = i+1) {
		message = message + i + " ";
	}

	return message;
}

var limit = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number"));
var output = countToX(limit);
alert(output);

					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>We created the variable <em>message</em> with an empty string</li>
						<li>We created a loop that will start at 0, and end while it is <em>less than or equal to</em> x</li>
						<li>For each iteration we will add 1 to i</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do (2)</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>So for the first iteration, i = 0, for the next one, i = 1, the next i = 2, and so on</li>
						<li>For each iteration, the expression i <= x is evaluated</li>
						<li>First it figures out if 1 <= 3, and the boolean that results from that (True) tells the loop to keep going</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do? (3)</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Within that loop, at each iteration we then added the number i, and then a space to message</li>
						<li>Note that message is getting longer each iteration. Why do think that is?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do? (4)</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Once i becomes less than or equal to x, the for loop terminates</li>
						<li>The function returns the message</li>
						<li>We then ask the user for a number, and pass it to the countToX function, and then print out the output to the console</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>While Loops</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What are while loops?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>For loops are good at repeating an action over and over again a set amount of times</li>
						<li>But what if we don't know when to stop repeating an action?</li>
						<li>This is a key opportunity to use while loops in</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What are while loops? (2)</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>A while loop executes as long as a condition is true</li>
						<li>The statements inside the loop should (eventually) make that condition false to end the loop</li>
						<li>Let's start with an action</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Let's use a while loop!</h1>
					<pre>
var answerQuestion = function() {
	var answer = prompt("What is 4 + 4");

	if (answer == "8") {
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}
}

answer = false;

while (answer != true) {
	answer = answerQuestion();
}

alert("Correct Answer!");
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>The answerQuestion function asks the user what is the answer to the math question</li>
						<li>If it's correct, return true, if not, return false</li>
						<li>We then execute a while loop that continues until answerQuestion returns true</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Up to now we have been using single variables</li>
						<li>Sometimes you want to store a list of variables</li>
						<li>Perhaps you want to represent something more complicated in code</li>
						<li>You can use Arrays and Objects for this purpose
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Let's start with a compound example</h1>
					<pre>
var student = {
	name: "Kay Ashaolu",
	id: 232324,
	lab_grades: [1, 1, 1],
	assignment_grades:[87, 98, 82]
};

alert(student);
alert(student.name);
alert(student["lab_grades"]);
alert(student.assignment_grades[2]);
					</pre>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did that do?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>We created an object and stored it in the variable "student"</li>
						<li>We then attempted to display the object</li>
						<li>Then we printed the student's name</li>
						<li>Then the student's lab grades</li>
						<li>Then the student's third assignment grade
							<ul><li>Array indexes start from 0</li></ul>
						</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>One more example</h1>
					<pre>
var student = {};

student.name = prompt("Enter your name");
student.attempts = [];

answer = false
while(answer != true) {
	value = prompt("What is 8+8?");
	student.attempts.push(value);

	if(value == "16") {
		answer = true;
	}
	else {
		answer = false;
	}
}

alert(student.name + " answers: " + student.attempts);
					</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>What did that do?</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>We created an object (student) where you can store her name and her attempts to the question "What is 8+8?"</li>
						<li>In a while loop, we store the results in an array</li>
						<li>We then print the previous attempts that she made</li>
					</ul>
