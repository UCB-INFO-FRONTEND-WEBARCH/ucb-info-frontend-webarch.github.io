# Assignment 1
## Build a static website

Our assignments are going to be built around building a blog from the ground up and eventually hosting your blog in the cloud. For this first assignment, you are going to take the content that is in the raw_content folder and build a blog out of it.

You will use HTML and CSS  to build a static web page using the content that is provided in the link below. The content contains five blog articles that will be separate pages on your website.

[Download content for website here](https://ucb-info-frontend-webarch.github.io/assignments/a-build-a-static-website-resources.zip)

You will need to do the following:

**Create a homepage**
 - With a heading to designate the title of the web page
 - With links to all five of the blog entries that are in the raw_content folder
 
**Create five blog posts with the content in the raw_content folder**
 - Mark up the content using **semantic** HTML tags (h1, p, section, etc...)
 - These files are written in markdown format. We went over markdown briefly, but here's a [quick reference](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/printable-markdown-cheat-sheet/). The goal is to use the correct HTML tag for what the markdown markup specified.

**Create an About Us page**
 - You can write whatever content you would like in this page about your self
 - Make sure you mark up the content using **semantic** html tags

**Look and feel**
 - Must have a header and a footer on every page that contains the following links: the homepage, the About us page, and the Contact Us page
 - Must specifically style the header with one css style
 - Must specifically style the footer with one css style
 - Must link at least one external CSS style sheet that **you have written yourself**
 - Must style at least one *element*, one *class*, and one *id* and use it somewhere on your web page
 - Must use styles that cascade, i.e. some element whose style is affected by more than 1 declaration in your CSS file

**Other requirements**
 - HTML and CSS must validate! Use the Markup Validation Service for [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload+with_options) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

**Extra Credit**
 - Use native CSS Grid capabilities or another CSS framework to style the website
