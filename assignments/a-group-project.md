# Project

## Build something awesome

## For this project you will accomplish the following

- Build an application of your choosing with yourself and some of your classmates
- Learn how to collaborate to build a single application
- Show off your skills

## The project is split into two parts

- Part I: Defining your project and building your teams
- Part II: Implementing your project idea, presenting to the class, and writing about it

## Your team of 4-5 people (non-negotiable, no groups of 1, 2, or 3) must complete the following

- Think of a front end web application that you would like to build
- Build the front end web application that you came up with
- Utilize at least one external API
- Demo the front end web application and present it to the rest of the class
- Submit a write-up that consists of a description of the web application that was built

## Part I

### Split into teams of 4-5 and submit a project idea

- There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Each team must have at least 4 people. If need be I will form teams.
- Each team needs to come up with the front end web application that they would like to build. Here are some examples:
  - A Todo application
  - The game of chess
- We will take a look at initial drafts of the web application that you have chosen to build and comment on the feasibility of your project idea and return with comments
- We will send a github classroom link to each group to create your own repository
- Be sure to start this project and add all of the people in your group to the same repository

## Part II

### Build your application

- Each team will have one repository where they will push their changes
- This could be the first time you were not the only users in your own repository. Beware of merge conflicts and editing the same file with someone else
- git pull often

### Utilize structured help from the weekly standups during the lab portion of class and maintain project board

- After lecture each team will conduct a standup with one of us
- We will ask everyone on the team three questions:
  - What were you able to do this past week?
  - What are you planning to do next week?
  - Is there anything blocking you from completing your task
- This is a time to allow us to unblock you or give any advice that could help your project
- You are to also maintain a [project board](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) on github to track the progress of everyone on the team.

### Prepare and deliver for your presentation at the end of class

- Prep for a 10 minute presentation, and 5 minutes for questions
- You are allowed **5 slides** for your presentation. The majority of the demo should be the application itself
- There will be a deduction if more than 5 slides are used in the presentation

### Commit all changes in repo and write a paper on what you did and name it LEARNINGS.md

- A description of what your project does and the functionality that it provides
- A list of at least ten different web technologies that you used in your web application and where they are used
